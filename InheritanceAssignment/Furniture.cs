{/*1.Create a class called furniture which has Data Members like
•	OrderId
•	OrderDate
•	FurnitureType
•	Qty
•	TotalAmt
•	PaymentMode (credit/debit card)
Furniture Type can be Chair/Cot
•	Derive the Chair and Cot class from Furniture class
If Chair Class then data members are
Chair type – Wood/Steel/Plastic
•	purpose – Home/office
•	If Wood Chair then Wood Type would be Teak Wood/Rose Wood
•	If Steel Chair then it would be Gray Steel/Green Steel/Brown Steel
•	If Plastic Color would be Green/Red/Blue/White
•	Rate

If Cot class then Data Members are
•	Cot Type – Wood / Steel
Same Data Members defined for Wood/Steel chair will be applicable for this.
•	Capacity – Single/Double
•	Rate
All the classes should have GetData() to accept user input and ShowData() to display the details .
Create  a Console Application to arrive at the Solution.
•	Hint : Implement the solution using Inheritance Concept.
